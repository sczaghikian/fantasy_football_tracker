This project uses [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) for dependency management. To install a new environment, run `pipenv install` from the root of this repo. Other useful commands include `pipenv update` to ensure the `Pipfile.lock` is up to date and `pipenv --venv` to display the path to the virtual environment created by Pipenv.
